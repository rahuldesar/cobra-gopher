TODO:

- [ ] Setup config file if missing.
  - Test yml/toml/json - maybe all?? (not sure if other is needed)
- [ ] Install using `makefile` ?
- [ ] Run `script` file using command
- [ ] Run `cli` app using command (and install if missing ??, maybe this is out of scope)
- [ ] Test bash completions
- [ ] Better help page, find some good `man` pages to follow

### Extra (would love to)

- CLI components
  - [Lipgloss: Style Terminal Layout](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
